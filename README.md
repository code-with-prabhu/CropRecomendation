## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts optimal crops using machine learning algorithms
- Inputs: Soil nutrient like pH, N, P, K etc.
- Web interface built with **Streamlit**
- PDF report generation for user inputs and prediction results


## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost**
- **Streamlit** â€“ for web UI
- **ReportLab** â€“ for PDF report generation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ for data visualization

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

1. User enters soil nutrient data via Streamlit UI
2. Trained ML model predicts the most suitable crop
3. User can download a PDF report of their input and the prediction
